# exploreAppleHealthDat_Sp25

This project uses data exported from my iPhone health app to explore questions such as how my biometrics vary over seasons and on weekends versus weekdays. I clean and visualize the data, perform dimensionality reduction and interpret the resulting principal components, and model the relationship between activity and temporal cycles using generalized linear models.
